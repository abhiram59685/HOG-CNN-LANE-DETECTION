# HOG-CNN-LANE-DETECTION
In this research, we developed a car detection system by utilizing the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction technique on car images. Utilized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze video clips and accurately identify the drive-able lanes for optimal vehicle movement, enhancing safety and navigation capabilities.
